# 12.4. Exercises
# A couple of practical examples:

# - Create a script that writes a boot image to a diskette using the dd utility. 
# If the user tries to interrupt the script using Ctrl+C, display a message 
# that this action will make the diskette unusable.

# - Write a script that automates the installation of a third-party package 
# of your choice. The package must be downloaded from the Internet. 
# It must be decompressed, unarchived and compiled if these actions are appropriate. 
# Only the actual installation of the package should be uninterruptable.
